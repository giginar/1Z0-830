Concept	                            Detail
List must be sorted	                Otherwise, result is undefined
Not found â†’ -(insertionPoint)-1	    Helps determine where to insert while maintaining order
Custom Comparator must match	    Use same Comparator for both sort() and binarySearch()
Can return 0-based index	        If found, returns actual index
Works with primitives and objects	As long as types are Comparable or you supply a Comparator
