ðŸ“˜ Hashing Essentials (OCP-Level)
Rule	                                Explanation
equals() and hashCode() must align	    If two objects are equal, their hashCodes must also be equal
Mutable fields are dangerous	        Changing the object after insertion breaks hashing logic
HashSet and HashMap use hashCode()	    For storing, retrieving, removing elements
TreeSet/TreeMap uses compareTo()	    Not equals() for comparison
Default equals() checks reference	    Not contents, unless overridden
