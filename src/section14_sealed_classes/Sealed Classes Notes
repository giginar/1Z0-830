ðŸ“˜ Sealed Class â€“ OCP Summary
Concept	                Description
sealed	                Limits which classes/interfaces can extend or implement
permits	                Lists permitted subclasses
final	                The class cannot be subclassed further
non-sealed	            Removes restriction; allows normal inheritance
Usage in switch	        Enables compiler-enforced exhaustiveness
OCP Tip	                Every subclass must declare if itâ€™s final, sealed, or non-sealed
